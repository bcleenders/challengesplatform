  %h1 Challenge guidelines
%p
  These guidelines are there to ensure that a challenge will meet our requirements. So they should give you a clear oversight of our expectations. A challenge consist out of various parts and this document will describe each headliner shortly.

%h2 Lead
%p
  This should be something that inspires a student, a short catchy description of your challenge. Find a good balance between catchiness and a formal description. Here are some examples to learn from;

      %b Would you survive the titanic cruise? 
      %br
      %small Predict with either a passenger will survive the cruise based on their information using machine learning tools
    %li
      %b Show what you can do with 6 Billion webpages 
      %br
      %small run your own mapreduce analysis at the SURFSARA's hadoop cluster containing the commoncrawl database

%h2 Description
%p
  This is very important and will be reviewed thoroughly, the description needs to give a detailed overview about what the student can expect from a challenge. There are two types of challenges, open goal and closed goal challenges. 

%h3 Open goal
%p
  The goal will be that a student will use the resources you specify meaning that the goal is less specific. It must be very clear what a student will do with the resources provided. In the case of the challenge <b>"Show what you can do with 6 Billion webpages"</b> the description must contain that the student will come up with there own more specific goal e.g. <i>"What is the readability of the web - <a href="http://norvigaward.github.io/entries.html#naward14" target="_blank">link</a>"</i>, <i>"associating Concepts using the World Wide Web - <a href="http://norvigaward.github.io/entries.html#naward13" target="_blank">link</a> "</i> or <i>"An analysis of the use of JavaScript libraries on the web - <a href="http://norvigaward.github.io/entries.html#naward18" target="_blank">link</a>"</i>  but it is required that they will use the commoncrawl database, the SURFSara cluster and write a short paper about their analysis. The student is completely free in what he or she will do within the open goal you specify.

%h3 Closed goal
%p
  This is the form with a specific goal, a student can not define their own sub goal. The tools used to achieve the goal does not have to be specified, however this can be the case if you want to. This form will probably result in a clear focus for the student, however it might be easier and less challenging.
%p
  For some challenges it might be handy that you specify some prerequisites. But keep in mind while defining your prerequisites that the more requirements you specify the less students will fit. Only fill in the prerequisites that are really required, from our experience we can say that students are quick learners and most required prerequisites are learned on the fly. The last and final element is a short descriptive introduction of the supervisors. Just tell in a few words what your background is.

%h2 Location
%p
  Most challenge will take place on the university so we will take care of this!

%h2 Commitment
%p
  Students have full schedules so it is important that they know how much time they need to invest in a challenge. Be honest with yourself and fill in the required amount of time. 

%h2 Duration
